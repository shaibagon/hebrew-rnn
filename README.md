## Hebrew RNN - Training a Hebrew Language Model using PyTorch
This is a toy project implementing a simple char-based languge model using deep LSTM model.

### Training data
In principle, the model can be trained on any large enough sequence of characters.  
This implementation used a copy of the bible in hebrew from [Machon Mamre](https://www.mechon-mamre.org/dlk.htm).
To use it for trining the model, doenload and unzip it to subfolder `./k`.
